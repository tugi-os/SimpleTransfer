# SimpleTransfer Contract

This is a simple Solidity smart contract that allows users to transfer Ether from one address to another. The contract includes an event to log each transfer made, ensuring transparency in transactions.

## Features

- **Transfer Ether**: Users can send Ether to a specified address.
- **Event Logging**: Each transfer is logged with sender, receiver, and amount details.

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in Solidity and smart contract development.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum network.
2. Call the `transfer` function with the recipient's address and the amount to send.
